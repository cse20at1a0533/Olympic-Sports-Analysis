          The Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, is the larger of the two main categories
          of the Olympic Games. It features a wide range of sports that are contested during the warmer months. The
          Summer Olympics cover a diverse set of disciplines, including athletics, swimming, gymnastics, football
          (soccer), basketball, volleyball, tennis, and many others. The event is held every four years, with
          participants from countries all over the world competing for medals in their respective sports. The Summer
          Olympics showcase the pinnacle of athletic achievement and serve as a global celebration of sportsmanship,
          unity, and cultural exchange.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
          The Winter Olympics, officially known as the Olympic Winter Games, is the counterpart to the Summer Olympics.
          It focuses on sports and disciplines played on snow and ice during the colder months. Some of the Winter
          Olympic sports include alpine skiing, snowboarding, ice hockey, figure skating, bobsleigh, and curling, among
          others. Like the Summer Olympics, the Winter Games occur every four years but in alternating even-numbered
          years. The Winter Olympics offer athletes from various countries an opportunity to compete in unique and
          challenging conditions, showcasing their skills and abilities on icy tracks, snowy slopes, and frozen rinks.

        <h5 class="card-title">Paralympic Games:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Paralympic Games are an international multi-sport event designed for athletes with
          physical, intellectual, and visual impairments. These games are held shortly after the conclusion of the
          respective Olympic Games in the same host city. Athletes compete in various Paralympic sports, which are
          adapted from traditional Olympic sports but modified to accommodate the abilities of athletes with
          disabilities. Some of the Paralympic sports include wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, para athletics
          (track and field), para swimming, para cycling, and para table tennis, among others. The Paralympics aim to
          promote inclusivity, challenge stereotypes, and inspire individuals with disabilities to pursue sports at the
          highest level while showcasing their incredible athletic talents</p>
